# Genome Tree Database (GTDB)

<b>[This project is in active development. It is not intended for public use.]</b>

The GTDB provides the software infrastructure for working with a large collections of genomic resources. The database contains
all genomes from the NCBI Assembly DB. Functionality is provided to generate multiple sequence alignments from specified sets 
of phylogenetically informative marker genes. Metadata for genomes is provided as a TSV file. The  goal of this initiative is 
to provide a phylogenetically consistent and rank normalized taxonomy for archaea and bacteria.
