# Genome Tree Database (GTDB)

<b>[This project is in active development. It is not intended for public use.]</b>

The GTDB provides the software infrastructure for working with a large collections of genomic resources. The database contains
genomes aquired from NCBI along with population genomes recovered at the Australian Centre for Ecogenomics and by our 
collaborators. Functionality is provided to generate multiple sequence alignments from specified sets of phylogenetically informative
marker genes. Metadata for genomes is provided as a comma separated values file and as an ARB database. The major goal of 
this initiative is to provide a phylogenetically consistent taxonomy for archaea and bacteria.
