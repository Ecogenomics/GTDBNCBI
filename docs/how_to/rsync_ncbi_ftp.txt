in /srv/db/ncbi/from_ftp:
	run rsync:
		./rsync_genbank.sh
		./rsync_refseq.sh
	we then copy all refseq records from the ftp folder to the /srv/db/gtdb/genomes/ncbi/*new_date* folder:
		mkdir /srv/db/gtdb/genomes/ncbi/2016_02_26
		
		
		

How update_refseq_from_ftp.py works:

	- for each domain:
		- we list the Refseq records present in the FTP folder (they have to be qualified as latest)
		- we list the Refseq records present in the previous GTDB folder
		- if a genome is present in the FTP list but not in the old GTDB list:
			We add the genome folder to the new gtdb folder
			TODO: Check if the new genome is actually a new version of an existing genome and replace the old one by this new one
		- if a genome is not present in the FTP 
			We delete the genome from GTDB
			We modify the lists having the deleted genomes.
		if the genomes is present in both FTP and old GTDB:
			We compare the checksum file of the 2 folder
			If the checksum of the genomic.fna.gz and/or protein.faa.gz files are different:
				-We copy the FTP folder to the new GTDB folder
				-We unzip all gz file in the new GTDB folder
				-We update the sha sizes in the GTDB 
			If checksum of the genomic.fna.gz and/or protein.faa.gz files are the same:
				-We copy the old GTDB folder to the new GTDB folder
				-We compare the genbank files between the GTDB folder and FTP folder:
				If there is a change:
					We copy the genbank files from FTP that are different from the GTDB folder
					We copy the checksum files from FTP
				-We compare the report files between the GTDB folder and FTP folder:
				If there is a change:
					We copy the report files from FTP that are different from the GTDB folder
					
					
Genomes are added through the INSERT command  in the genome table.
No Metadata is generated at this stage. Metadata are generated later.
