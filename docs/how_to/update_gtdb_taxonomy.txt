The taxonomy for the genome tree is in a fairly
constant state of flux. As such, it needs to be
updated on a regular basis. Updating the database
is complicated by a few factors:

- provided taxonomy files often do not cover all
7 canonical ranks and my not properly use binomial
names for species

- the taxonomy of representative genomes must be 
propogated to all genomes clustered with the
representative

- updated taxonomy files may not cover all genomes
in the database as curators often focus on specific
parts of the tree

The GenomeTreeTk provides functionality for allowing
new taxonomy strings to be quickly corrected, verified,
and expanded:

1) run the 'fill_ranks' command so all taxonomy strings
cover all 7 canonical ranks
2) run the 'binomial' command to ensure all species names
use binomial nomenclature
3) run the 'propogate' command to propagate taxonomy strings
from representatives to all genomes clustered with the a 
representative
4) re-run the 'validate' command to ensure the taxonomy file is
properly formated and to identify potential issues

The final taxonomy file can then be inserted into the GTDB using
the 'metadata_add_taxonomy_to_database.py' script in 
/gtdb/scripts_dev.
